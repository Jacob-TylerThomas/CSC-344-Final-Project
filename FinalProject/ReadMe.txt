Devleoper's notes:
1. I seperated the different steps into sections once it prints to the console according to the steps listed in Kim's project pdf.
2. Steps 2, 3, and 4 are slightly out of order just from how I wrote my code but they are still labeled appropriately. 
3. I was unable to get the visiting nodes completely working so step 5 is incomplete but still has some functionality.
4. If there is only one finger table printing for the visiting nodes then that means nStart was both the starting node and ending node.
5. If there are any issues in running the program or questions about the steps then contact me at jtt8745@uncw.edu
